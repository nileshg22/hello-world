Testing out github

Hello! I am Nilesh Gupta, a statistics & computer science major in the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Currently, I am proficient in R, Python, Java, and C++. I will begin working on a project involving a raspberry pi, and will most likely post my code for that soon. Until then, see you!
